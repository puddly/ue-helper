# UE Helper
macOS status bar application that allows you to remotely control UE speakers.

## Warning
BLE scanning is never stopped so this will probably drain your battery quickly. A future update will start and stop when the menu is actually opened.

Actual Swift developers are welcome to tell me how broken it is.
